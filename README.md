# toucans-team-07
Toucans 07 is working to create a comprehensive landing page for single and divorced parents. 
Ultimately, the goal is to allow not only parents, but anyone with a vested interest in the child (children) to
do a number of things.

For example, we plan to allow a sharable calendar option. This will be a great place to enter upcoming events, and reminders. For example, let's say a child has a play in three weeks. No problem. Anyone with access (and write priveledges) can create an entry and setup reminders.

It could also function to alert parents of upcoming doctor appointments, required vaccines, etc.

We are currently sorting out the layout and design of our site.

We are also using Skype to communicate on a regular basis.

We are working on a website for new parents. The goal is for it to remind them of all the important things they need to take care of when they first have a baby.
